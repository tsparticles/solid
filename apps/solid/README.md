# Example App

This project was bootstrapped by following the
[Solid Getting Started](https://www.solidjs.com/guides/getting-started) guide
using to following command.

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/ts solid
```

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via
`pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package
manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a
template.

```bash
npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
